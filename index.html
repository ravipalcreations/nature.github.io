                <h2>Mountains</h2>
                <p>A mountain is an elevated portion of the Earth's crust, generally with steep sides that show
                    significant exposed bedrock. A mountain differs from a plateau in having a limited summit area, and
                    is larger than a hill, typically rising at least 300 metres (1000 feet) above the surrounding land.

                <h2>River</h2>
                <p>A river is a natural flowing watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing towards an ocean, sea, lake or
                    another river. In some cases, a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course
                    without reaching another body of water</p>

                <h2>Water fall</h2>
                <p>A waterfall is a river or other body of water's steep fall over a rocky ledge into a plunge pool
                    below. ... Often, waterfalls form as streams flow from soft rock to hard rock. This happens both
                    laterally (as a stream flows across the earth) and vertically</p>
